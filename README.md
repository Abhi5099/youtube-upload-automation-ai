# YouTube Upload Automation with AI Metadata  

## About  
This project automates YouTube video uploads by:  
1. Pulling video files from **Google Drive**.  
2. Generating SEO-optimized **descriptions and tags** using **OpenAI (ChatGPT)**.  
3. Uploading to **YouTube** with strict compliance for Shorts (9:16 aspect ratio, <60 seconds).  

Ideal for content creators seeking to save time, improve video rankings, and maintain platform standards.
